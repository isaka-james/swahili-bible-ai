# Swahili Bible AI

Swahili Bible AI is a project aimed at developing a Transformer-based language model to analyze and generate text in Swahili, specifically focusing on the Bible. The project leverages modern deep learning techniques to build a robust model capable of understanding and generating coherent Swahili text. This project can be used for various applications, including text generation, text analysis, and finding related words or verses within the Bible.

The core of the project is built around a Transformer model, which is known for its effectiveness in natural language processing tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of Swahili Bible verses, allowing it to learn the intricacies of the language and the context within the Bible. The Transformer model uses multi-head attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks to process and generate text, making it a powerful tool for language understanding and generation.

One of the key features of this project is its ability to generate text word by word, providing an interactive and responsive experience. Users can input a prompt, and the model will generate the subsequent text incrementally, allowing for real-time observation of the text generation process. Additionally, the project includes functionalities to find related words and search for specific verses within the Bible, making it a comprehensive tool for text analysis.

In the future, this project has the potential to help people answer questions using only Bible contexts. By generating responses based on the Bible's content, the Swahili Bible AI can provide insights and answers that are grounded in the scripture. This can be particularly useful for educational purposes, religious studies, and personal inquiries.

The project is implemented in C++ using the Eigen library for matrix operations and linear algebra. The code is structured to be modular and easy to understand, with clear separation between the model definition, data loading, and text generation functionalities. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to get started with using the Swahili Bible AI for your own text analysis and generation tasks.
